# Creatures
Creatures represent partially inteligent beings, as opposed to fully inteligent beings (Races/Species). Creatures are a subclass of species, which have yet to be uplifted into full races/species.

Domesticated animals are simple examples of what counts as a creature.

### Important
This is just a classification to distinguish species that can conceptualize the self, form language and cohearant thoughts, and can outwardly express this to other species. Players can play as these creatures, but it would mostly be boring unless they are modified to increase inteligence.
