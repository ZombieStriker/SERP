# FAQ
## Can I be a "pure human"/ Human remnant,
The answer to this is, if a player wants to be a pure human (one without modifications or genetic changes), they aren't fully understanding the univserse they are playing in. 

You have the vastness of expression to show what traits your character/species has. You have the ability to modify yourself to your heart's content. And yet you choose to play the default race with no changes?

So, I don't feel a player should **want** to be a pure human. If they do, they are showing a lack of understanding of this framework.

## How to deal with players that want to be human
Tell them to read these documents, and explore the possiblities of what their character could be. If you need to do so in a in-univserse way, explain that most beings are descendants to humans, so "what kind of human are you?"
