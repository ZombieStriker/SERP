# [ SERP ] Space. Exploration. RolePlay
 Space Exploration RolePlay, hereby refered to as SERP, is a roleplay experience to allow a community to create their own species, own lore, and interact with other players without overstepping bounds or creating conflicting lore/paradoxes/inconsistancies.

 This github repo will house markdown files of all the individual lore aspects of this in game universe, as well as information on how to contribute, spin off, or interact with this framework in any capacity.

 ## Why is this needed?
 If you have, or know of someone else who has tried to collaborate in fantasy/science fiction universes, you know that different people can have different understandings of the universe created. These differences may create inconsistancies between each creator's intent of the unviserse. This ultimately creates problems in story telling later on, either creating plotholes in the past, or retconing information in the future. This ultimately ruins the experience for those dedicated to a lore-consistant universe, and those that cherish and respect the universe created.

 As a way to counter lore-inconsistanciess, this framework is intended to provide limited freedom by requiring links to documents or notes, as well as community voting to decide if a piece of work should be considered "cannon" or allow exist in this unviserse.

 ## How review and processing is done
 In order for a submission of content to be added to the lore, a branch or fork is needed on the github repo. On that new branch or fork, create all the necessary lore needed, following the requirements for the addition of new content (more on this later), and then submit a pull request or merge request.

 From there, the heads of the github repository will review your content, and make suggestions or recommendations if needed to better fit the universe that has been established. Lore inconsistancies will be looked for, and if they are found, will either deny or ask for editing of the lore with the inconsistancy.

 If no lore inconsistancies are found, and if the owners of the repo approve of the lore contribution, it may be added as cannon lore to the repo.

 ## How to format your contribution
This repo is broken down into multiple folders, each containing its own README.md, which should explain the process for creating subfolders or your own creation. Each folder should also contain an example document to show how a contribution should look.

It is recommended to keep all files as markdown (.md) files, and use the markdown format when possible. When using markdown, use links to redirect to other content on the repo, like below.

Using links, make sure to link to all the content or sources referenced in your page atleast once. This makes sure all content is available and easily accessable.

If inspiration or insider information is needed for context about a page, please leave it to the bottom of the file with headers clearly marking the rest of the document as being for inspiration/insider information.
