# Advancements
This is a section for all advancements made across all species in the universe. This helps keep track of all sciences and technology that exist.

## Real Life Advancement
If reality already has an advancement (Such as blackpowder, cars, the wheel, ect.), you can safely assume most other races have this advancement in this universe, and does not need to be specified.

## Forbidden Advancements
These advancements should never be included in any form to this framework.

Most of these can be summed up to "don't metagame, don't ruin others experiences, let others have fun their own way".

### Reality/Cross-Dimensional Weapons of Mass Destruction
Should be simple enough. Don't create advancements that could destroy the multiverse, all of reality. This is a big self destruct button, and only exists to be pressed and end the  game for everyone, which should never happen.
### Time Travel Devices
For the sake of arguement, there should be no changing of the core timeline of a universe. If something is cannon, you would need to create a seperate multiverse (I.E github fork) to make changes to events that happened in a universe already.

Basically, don't overwrite existing lore, unless you want to create your own version of this whole thing.
### Multiversal Transporters/ Cross Multiversal Empires
You can have fun in your own reality. Down try to overrun other's experiences with content from your multiverse, expecting them to respect it.
