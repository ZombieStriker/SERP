## History
After humans began their expansion into neighboring star systems around 10,000 Before Unification Era (BUE), many colony ships containing humans and variants took thousands of years with Sub-Light travel to distant stars. Knowing that spaceflight will inheritly genetically alter the population, the Puresses militantly controled who was allowed offspring, and gentically modified or destroyed any deviants from the core human form.

After only a few hundred years of spaceflight, the Puresses ended up at their target destination. They renamed their system NeoSolis to reflect the star system their kind came from, and called their planet Eden, based off religious text kept sacred to them.
