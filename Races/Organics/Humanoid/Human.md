## History
One of the oldest species known in the universe, Humans are an anchient race, and the precursor to most of the humanoid variations across the universe. The exact age of the human species is unknown, but could easily date back hundreds of thousands of years before the Unification Era (UE). Originating on Earth, in the Sol system, humans had an agressive history: One primarily motivated by war and dominance. Advancement to standards of living most of the time only occured due to these conflicts.
