## History
After humans began their expansion into neighboring star systems around 10,000 Before Unification Era (BUE), many colony ships containing humans and variants took thousands of years with Sub-Light travel to distant stars. Through Genetic Modification and natural mutations, the colonists entering the ST-M-19869, although resembling humans to a large extent, were altered enough to be considered their own species.

Due to thousands of years societal changes, and not a lot of historical it is hard to document all cultural changes made during those years. However, distinct cultural shifts happened by the time the species now known as the Nyn reached Aphen. Most Nyn culture and philosophy centers around a hedonistic utilitarianism. Optimizing for pleasure and enjoyment of existance for all sentient beings they encounter.
