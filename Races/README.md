# [ SERP ] Races

## Introduction

A "Race" is the catagorization of a species in the universe, such as to easily reference and distinguish a collection of traits for a character. If a collection of traits is inheritable through genetics for a race, such that the offspring'd traits are different than the original parents, then it is its own race.

### Breakdown Guide: 
Races are separated into two catagories; Mechoids and Organics. Mechoids are races that do not have biological reproduction, and as such, rely on computer information for the passage of their genetic information. Organics, on the other hand, use biological material such as but not limited to, DNA, RNA, or protiens to pass genetic information.

For organics, the next tier in catagorization is their Phylum. This catagory determines the core collection of traits of a Race, and what biological features should be predominant across all characters of this race. Under Phylum, then is the individual races, or branches of biological expression for a single phylum. Minor mutations or variations exist on the Race level, while Phylum level is used for drastic genetic modifications.
